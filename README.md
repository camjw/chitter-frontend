# Chitter Frontend

## Usage

Clone the app and run `npm start`. Then go to `localhost:3000` and watch in wonder as the refresh button refreshes the chitter feed. That's it though.

## Tests

To run the tests, first make sure you've installed all the dependencies by running `npm install`, then run `npm test` to run the tests. Most of the tests make use of Jest's 'snapshots' to compare the results of some mounting to some expected HTML. These are saved in the `__snapshots__` folders, where appropriate.
